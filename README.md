An XBMC addon that can be used to watch MTV Italy shows hosted on MTV Ondemand

# Installation

You can just clone this repository in your ~/.xbmc/addon/ folder.

# Important Notice

Unfortunately AFAIK MTV does not provides a set of API that can be used in order to watch their shows from external sources so what this addon does is parse the content on ondemand.mtv.it. Which means that it is very fragile and will break on changes done on the site, which are out of my control.
